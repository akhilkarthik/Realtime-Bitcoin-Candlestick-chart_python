# Bitcoin Market Live chart
This project is a real-time Bitcoin candlestick chart built using the Dash web framework. It fetches live Bitcoin price data from the CoinGecko API and visualizes the latest 100 candles in a candlestick chart. The chart is updated every 6 seconds to provide a dynamic view of Bitcoin's price movement.
